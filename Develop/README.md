# password-generator

In this assignment, the goal was to randomly generate a password that would render for the user after having answered a series of prompts. The password would have a certain length, be random, and would react with how the user chooses their preference of random charaters, numbers, lowercase, and uppercase letters. Finally, the password would be generated after all the prompts have been fulfilled.
