DONE 1.) When click  -> Then start asking them questions about password criteria

DONE 2.) 

DONE 3.) After they answer the prompts --> check if its between 8 - 128
        if correct --> Move on to asking questions || if NOT tell them they need a correct pick

DONE 4.) Confirm if they want lowercase           
        Confirm if they want uppercase
        Confirm if they want special characters
        Confirm if they want numeric

DONE 5.) After they answer each prompt/confirm -> we have to check if they select at least one character type 
        (At least one of the above have to be "Ok" all of them cant be "cancel") DONE!

6.) When finished with prompts --> Then start to build password 
    give the user a string based on what they've written 

        generate something that == length that the user wanted
specialcharacters - where are these special characters stored, how are you access them to generate in the password
same process applies to lower and uppercase letters -- in class, upper and lower case letters have different ASCII codes

once you figure that out
how many of each are you going to put into the password that is within the length that the user wants



7.) When password is built --> then display on page as alert or put it in page 
        after all is done --- append the password to DOM
